1
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,439
Forget it. it's too risky.
I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,991
You always say that.
The same thing every time.

3
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,990
“I'm through, never again,
too dangerous.”

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,538
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right too.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,034
You forget about it in a day or two.
The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,209
The days of me remembering
have just begun.

7
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,483
You know, when you go on like this,
what you sound like?

8
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,499
I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:55,094
Quack, quack, quack. Take heart, 'cause
you're never gonna have to hear it again.

10
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,593
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're
never gonna have to hear me quack.

11
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:03,390
After tonight? Correct. I
got all tonight to quack.

12
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,355
Can I get anyone more coffee?
Oh, yes!

13
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,730
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,904
I mean, the way it is now,

15
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,779
you're takin' the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,905
Takin' more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

17
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,988
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop
you in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,292
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck?
I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.

19
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,837
Heard about this one bloke, he walks
into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,881
He gives the phone to a teller.
The bloke on the other end says,

21
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,573
“We got this guy's little girl. if you don't
give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.”

22
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:39,437
- Did it work? - Fuckin' right it
worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.

23
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:45,265
Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone,
not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

24
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,982
Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin'
finger. Did they hurt the little girl?

25
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,777
There probably never was a little girl.
The point of the story isn't a little girl.

26
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,822
The point of the story is they
robbed a bank with a telephone.

27
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,866
- You want to rob banks?
- I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,432
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be
easier than what we've been doing.

29
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:06,575
- No more liquor stores? - What've we been
talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

30
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,731
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

31
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,733
Vietnamese, Koreans,
don't even speak fuckin' English.

32
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,152
You tell 'em empty out the register, they
don't know what you're talkin' about.

33
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,042
They make it too personal.

34
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:20,388
We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna
make us kill him. I'm not gonna kill anybody.

35
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:24,763
I don't want to either. But they'll probably
put us in a situation where it's us or them.

36
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,764
And if it's not the gooks,

37
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,542
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned
the store for 15 fucking generations.

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,981
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the
counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

39
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,049
Try walkin' into one of those places
with nothing but a phone.

40
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,939
See how far that gets you.
Forget it.

41
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,942
We're out of it.
Well, what then, day jobs?

42
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,115
Not in this life.
Day jobs?

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,452
<i>Garcon, coffee'.!</i>

44
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,829
This place.

45
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,414
<i>Garcon means boy.</i>

46
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,298
This place?
<i>A</i> coffee shop?

47
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,347
What's wrong with that?

48
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:07,097
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

49
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,475
Bars, liquor stores,

50
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,274
gas stations; you get your head
blown off' stickin' up one of them.

51
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,025
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

52
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,733
They're not expectin' to get robbed.
Not as expectin' anyway.

53
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:26,362
I bet you could cut down on the hero
factor in a place like this. Correct.

54
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,699
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

55
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,125
Manager.
He don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,052
They're just trying to get you out
before you start pluggin' the diners.

57
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:39,091
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way
they're takin' a bullet for the register.

58
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,090
Busboys. Some wetback gettin'
paid $1.50 an hour...

59
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,672
really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner?

60
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,912
Customers sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

61
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:52,601
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the
next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

62
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:57,731
See, I got the idea the last liquor
store we stuck up, remember?

63
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,483
- All the customers kept comin' in.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,408
You got the idea of ta kin' their wallets.
Now, that was a good idea.

65
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,828
- Thank you. - Made more from the
wallets than we did from the register.

66
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,243
Yes, we did. A lot of
people come to restaurants.

67
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,951
- A lot of wallets.
- Pretty smart, huh?

68
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,082
Pretty smart.

69
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,590
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

70

Come on. All right. Same
as last time, remember?

Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
Okay, what you want to know?

90
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,466
Hash is legal there, right? Yeah,
it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

91
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:16,175
You just can't walk into a restaurant,
roll a joint and start puffin' away.

00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,557
I mean, they want you to smoke in your
home or certain designated places.

93
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,306
Those are hash bars? Yeah.
It breaks down like this.

94
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,732
It's legal to buy it.
It's legal to own it.

95
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,982
And if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

96
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:32,488
It's illegal to carry it, but-but that
doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

97
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,946
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam,
it's illegal for them to search you.

98
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,996
I mean, that's a right the cops in
Amsterdam don? have. Oh, man! I'm goin'.

thing about Europe is? What?

102
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,425

little different. - Example.

They don't call it
a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

109

know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.

110
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,497
- What do they call it?

She used to be a actress.

Oh, really? She do
anything I'd have seen?

128
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:24,846
I think her biggest deal was she starred
in a pilot. Pilot? What's a pilot?

129
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,474
Well, you know the shows on TV?
I don't watch TV.

130
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,152
Yeah, but you are aware that there
is an invention called television,

131
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,363
and on this invention they
show shows, right? Yeah.

132
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,819
The way they pick TV shows is they make
one show. That show's called a pilot.

133
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,826
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

134
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,895
and on the strength of that one show, they
decide if they wanna make more shows.

135
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,459
Some get chosen and become television
programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

when he'd clone his duty, he went
home to your great-grandmother,

took the watch off, put it in an old
coffee can, and in that can it stayed...

until your granddad, Dane Coolidge,
was called upon by his country...

to go overseas and fight

about ever leaving that island alive,

976
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,194
so three days before
the Japanese took the island,

977
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,491
your granddad asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport, name of Winocki-

his gold watch.

dead, but Winocki kept his word.

he paid a visit to your grandmother,

He was captured, put in
a Vietnamese prison camp.

987
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:22,198
He knew if the gooks
ever saw the watch,

988
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:25,781
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

989
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:29,584
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

990
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:33,585

greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,

991
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:37,589

he could hide something-his ass.

992

Five long years
he wore this watch up his ass.

02:02:54,868 --> 02:02:59,328
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds
us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1778
02:02:59,455 --> 02:03:03,699
She wouldn't at that. That gives us 40
minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,

1779
02:03:03,793 --> 02:03:07,252
which, if you do what I say,
when I say it, should be plenty.

1780
02:03:07,338 --> 02:03:11,673
Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus
a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1781
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:17,637
[Sighs]

1782
02:03:19,392 --> 02:03:21,303
Jimmie.
Uh-huh.

1783
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:24,762
Do me a favour, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee back there.

1784
02:03:24,898 --> 02:03:28,357
Would you make me a cup?
Uh, yeah, sure.

1785
02:03:29,819 --> 02:03:32,732
Oh, uh, um, how do you take it?

1786
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:35,359
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1787
02:03:37,452 --> 02:03:40,865
About the car, is there anything
I need to know? Does it stall?

1788
02:03:40,955 --> 02:03:44,323
Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise?
Is there gas in it?

1789
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:47,872
Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
Positive?

1790
02:03:47,962 --> 02:03:51,330
Don't get me on the road and I find
out the brake lights don't work.

1791
02:03:51,466 --> 02:03:55,505
As far as I know, the motherfucker's
tip-top. Good enough.

1792
02:03:55,595 --> 02:03:57,586
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1793
02:04:00,767 --> 02:04:03,134
[ Exhales]

1794
02:04:03,269 --> 02:04:06,227
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.
Thank you, jimmie.

1795
02:04:11,069 --> 02:04:12,980
Mmm.

1796
02:04:14,072 --> 02:04:16,154
Okay, first thing.
You two.

1797
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:19,153
Take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

1798
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:21,905
This looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

1799
02:04:22,038 --> 02:04:25,997
That would lead me to believe you got
cleansers and shit. Yeah. Under the sink.

1800
02:04:26,084 --> 02:04:29,497
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products...

1801
02:04:29,587 --> 02:04:33,581
and clean the inside of the car-
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1802
02:04:33,675 --> 02:04:37,589
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those
little pieces of brain and skull.

1803
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:40,592
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

1804
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:43,595
It don't need to be spick-and-span.
You don't need to eat off it.

1805
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:48,020
Just give it a good once-over. What you need
to take care of are the really messy parts.

1806
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:52,191
The pools of blood that have collected,
you gotta soak that shit up.

1807
02:04:52,276 --> 02:04:54,688
We need to raid
your linen closet.

1808
02:04:54,779 --> 02:04:57,692
I need blankets, I need
comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1809
02:04:57,782 --> 02:05:01,400
The thicker the better, the darker the
better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1810
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:06,785
We'll need to camouflage the front
seat and back seat and floorboards...

1811
02:05:06,874 --> 02:05:08,785
with quilts and blankets,

1812
02:05:08,876 --> 02:05:12,790
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout
in the car, the subterfuge won't last,

1813
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:15,713
but at a glance the car
will appear to be normal.

1814
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:17,837
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

1815
02:05:17,927 --> 02:05:19,668
“Please” would be nice.

1816
02:05:21,139 --> 02:05:24,131
- Come again?
- I said, a “please” would be nice.

1817
02:05:25,977 --> 02:05:29,845
Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say
please. I'm here to tell you what to do.

1818
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:34,562
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess,

1819
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:37,064
you'd better fuckin' do it
and do it quick.

1820
02:05:37,155 --> 02:05:41,023
I'm here to help. If my help's not
appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1821
02:05:41,117 --> 02:05:44,405
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that;
your help is definitely appreciated.

1822
02:05:44,495 --> 02:05:47,408
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean
disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1823
02:05:47,498 --> 02:05:50,331
I just don't like people
barkin' orders at me.

1824
02:05:50,418 --> 02:05:53,410
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

1825
02:05:53,504 --> 02:05:58,123
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys
to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1826
02:05:58,217 --> 02:06:01,676
So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1827
02:06:06,184 --> 02:06:09,848
Don't be lookin' at me like that,
all right? I can feel your look.

1828
02:06:12,565 --> 02:06:15,227
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1829
02:06:15,318 --> 02:06:17,229
[Sipping]

1830
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:19,231
Green.

1831
02:06:20,865 --> 02:06:23,778
Nothin' except for
the mess inside.

1832
02:06:25,995 --> 02:06:28,407
Mmm, about 20 minutes.

1833
02:06:29,916 --> 02:06:31,873
Nobody who'll be missed.

1834
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:36,878
You're a good man, joe.
Thanks a bunch.

1835
02:06:37,965 --> 02:06:39,876
How we comin', Jimmie?
Pretty good.

1836
02:06:39,967 --> 02:06:43,085
I got it all here, but, uh,
[Sighs]

1837
02:06:43,221 --> 02:06:46,634
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1838
02:06:46,724 --> 02:06:50,217
Okay. You gotta understand
something, uh, Winston.

1839
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:52,222
Uh-Uh, no,
thank you.

1840
02:06:52,313 --> 02:06:55,431
Uh, this is our best linen here,

1841
02:06:55,525 --> 02:06:58,438
and it's, uh-
it was a wedding present...

1842
02:06:58,528 --> 02:07:00,895
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny.

1843
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:05,445
They're not with us anymore. I wanna
help-Let me ask you a question.

1844
02:07:05,535 --> 02:07:08,448
If you don't mind. No, no, please.
Go ahead.

1845
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:14,909
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt
Ginny, were they millionaires?

1846
02:07:16,087 --> 02:07:17,998
No.

1847
02:07:18,089 --> 02:07:20,501
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1848
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:23,959
And I'm positive that if
Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

1849
02:07:24,095 --> 02:07:26,507
Ginny.
Ginny were here,

1850
02:07:26,597 --> 02:07:30,841
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set,

1851
02:07:30,935 --> 02:07:34,098
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

1852
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:41,981
I like oak myself.
That's what I have in my bedroom.

1853
02:07:43,114 --> 02:07:45,071
How about you, jimmie?

1854
02:07:46,284 --> 02:07:48,241
You an oak man?

1855
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:51,285
Oak's nice.

1856
02:07:57,128 --> 02:08:00,962
Oh, man, I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

1857
02:08:01,048 --> 02:08:03,460
This is some fucked-up,
repugnant shit.

1858
02:08:03,551 --> 02:08:06,964
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits that he is wrong,

1859
02:08:07,054 --> 02:08:09,967
that he is immediately forgiven
for all wrongdoings?

1860
02:08:10,057 --> 02:08:12,970
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit!

1861
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,956
The motherfucker that said that shit never
had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...

1862
02:08:15,980 --> 02:08:19,723
on account of your dumb ass. I got a threshold,
jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1863
02:08:19,817 --> 02:08:23,401
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car,
and you got me in the red.

1864
02:08:23,487 --> 02:08:26,900
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous
to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1865
02:08:26,991 --> 02:08:28,857
That's all. I could blow.

1866
02:08:28,993 --> 02:08:30,904
Oh, you ready to blow?
Yeah.

1867
02:08:30,995 --> 02:08:33,908
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin'
motherfucker, motherfucker.

1868
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:36,911
Every time my fingers touch brain,
I'm Superfly T.N.T.

1869
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:38,912
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1870
02:08:39,003 --> 02:08:41,916
In fact, what the fuck
am I doin' in the back?

1871
02:08:42,006 --> 02:08:45,249
You're the motherfucker should be on
brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!

1872
02:08:45,343 --> 02:08:47,801
I'm washin' windows, you're
pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1873
02:08:57,521 --> 02:08:59,478
Fine job, gentlemen.

1874
02:09:00,816 --> 02:09:03,228
You may get out of this yet.

1875
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:05,731
I can't believe
this is the same car.

1876
02:09:05,821 --> 02:09:09,234
Well, let's not start suckin'
each other's dicks quite yet.

1877
02:09:09,325 --> 02:09:12,738
Phase one is complete-clean the car-
which moves us right along to phase two:

1878
02:09:12,828 --> 02:09:14,739
clean you two.

1879
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:18,164
Strip.

1880
02:09:18,292 --> 02:09:22,035
All the way? [Wolf]
To your bare ass.

1881
02:09:22,129 --> 02:09:25,167
Quickly, gentlemen.
We got about 15 minutes...

1882
02:09:25,258 --> 02:09:28,171
before Jimmie's better half
comes pulling into the driveway.

1883
02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:30,753
Goddamn, this morning air
is some chilly shit.

1884
02:09:30,846 --> 02:09:32,757
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

1885
02:09:32,848 --> 02:09:35,260
You know what you two look like?
[Vincent] What?

1886
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:38,764
Like a couple of guys who
just blew off somebody's head.

1887
02:09:38,854 --> 02:09:42,222
Strippin' off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

1888
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:48,987
Toss 'em in Jimmie's
garbage bag.

1889
02:09:49,073 --> 02:09:53,488
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this
shit out front for the garbageman to pick up.

1890
02:09:53,577 --> 02:09:57,787
Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
Jim, the soap.

1891
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:01,161
Vincent. [Wolf] Okay, gentlemen.

1892
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:04,711
You both been to county
before, I'm sure. Here it comes.

1893
02:10:04,839 --> 02:10:07,706
Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold!
Yo! Yo! Yo!

1894
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,963
Better you than me, gentlemen.
[Chuckling]

1895
02:10:11,095 --> 02:10:14,008
Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread
it around. [Yelling Continues]

1896
02:10:14,098 --> 02:10:16,965
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's
hair. - Hey, get out of my hair!

1897
02:10:17,059 --> 02:10:19,926
- Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!
- Uh, um-

1898
02:10:21,022 --> 02:10:22,933
Towel.

1899
02:10:33,451 --> 02:10:36,614
[Wolf] You're dry enough.
Toss 'em their clothes.

1900
02:10:36,704 --> 02:10:39,992
[Wolf Laughing]
Perfect.

1901
02:10:40,082 --> 02:10:43,495
Perfect. We couldn't have
planned this better.

1902
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:45,497
You guys look like-

1903
02:10:45,588 --> 02:10:47,955
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1904
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:51,674
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
[Laughing]

1905
02:10:51,761 --> 02:10:55,254
- [Both Laughing] - Ha-ha-ha.
They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1906
02:10:55,348 --> 02:10:58,056
Come on, gentlemen. We're laughing
our way right into prison.

1907
02:10:58,142 --> 02:11:00,099
Don't make me beg.

1908
02:11:03,147 --> 02:11:06,560
Okay, gentlemen, let's get our
rules of the road straight.

1909
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:10,188
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1910
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:13,192
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1911
02:11:13,282 --> 02:11:15,148
The place is North Hollywood,

1912
02:11:15,242 --> 02:11:19,236
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1913
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:22,664
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

1914
02:11:24,043 --> 02:11:26,000
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1915
02:11:26,087 --> 02:11:29,921
Now, if we come across the
path of any John Q. Laws,

1916
02:11:30,049 --> 02:11:33,132
nobody does a fuckin' thing
'til I do something. Right.

1917
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:36,093
What did I say?
Don't do shit unless.

1918
02:11:36,222 --> 02:11:38,509
Unless what?
Unless you do it first.

1919

02:19:57,890 --> 02:19:59,847
In the fucking bag.

2063
02:20:01,393 --> 02:20:04,852
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it. Now
get the fuck down on the floor.

2064
02:20:04,938 --> 02:20:07,350
In the bag.
In the bag.

2065
02:20:19,536 --> 02:20:21,493
In the bag.

2066
02:20:36,595 --> 02:20:39,508
- What's in the case?
- My boss' dirty laundry.

2067
02:20:39,598 --> 02:20:42,135
Your boss makes you do his laundry?
When he wants it clean.

2068
02:20:42,225 --> 02:20:44,887
- Sounds like a shit job.
- Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

2069

- Open it.
- 'Fraid I can't do that.

2070
02:20:49,942 --> 02:20:52,274
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, you did.

2071
02:20:53,403 --> 02:20:55,690
What's going on?

2072
02:20:55,781 --> 02:20:59,240
- Looks like we got a vigilante in
our midst. - Shoot him in the face!

2073
02:20:59,326 --> 02:21:03,035
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't
the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

2074
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:06,559
- If you don't take your hand off' that case,
it'll be your last. - Stop causing problems!

2075
02:21:06,583 --> 02:21:09,383
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em
what you got and get 'em outta here!

2076
02:21:09,461 --> 02:21:13,671
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't
none of your goddamn business!

2077
02:21:13,757 --> 02:21:15,998
Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.

2078
02:21:16,093 --> 02:21:18,130
No problem.
I got it under control.

2079
02:21:19,763 --> 02:21:21,754
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

2080
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:27,264
If you don't open that case, I'm
gonna unload in your fucking face.

2081
02:21:31,692 --> 02:21:33,603
We clear?

2082
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:38,691
One.

2083
02:21:40,534 --> 02:21:43,026
Two.

2084
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:45,157
Three.
Okay, Ringo.

2085
02:21:45,247 --> 02:21:47,329
You win.

2086
02:21:47,416 --> 02:21:49,327
It's yours.

2087
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:56,122

Hey, what is it?

2089
02:22:02,264 --> 02:22:04,596
What is it?

2090
02:22:04,683 --> 02:22:07,266
Is that what I think it is?

2091

- Tell that bitch to be cool.

2096

be cool!” Be cool! Be cool!

Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
I promise!

02:22:37,549 --> 02:22:39,381
Tell her to chill!
Chill out, honey bunny!

2102
02:22:39,509 --> 02:22:41,420
Now tell me her name.
Yolanda.

2103
02:22:41,511 --> 02:22:44,924
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not
gonna do anything stupid, are we?

2104
02:22:45,015 --> 02:22:47,928
- Don't you hurt him!
- Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

2105
02:22:48,018 --> 02:22:51,477
We're all gonna be like three little
Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

2106
02:22:51,605 --> 02:22:55,223
Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like?
He's cool.

2107
02:22:55,358 --> 02:22:57,224
What?
Cool.

Correctamundo.
And that's what we're gonna be.

We're gonna be cool.

2110
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:07,110
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2111
02:23:07,204 --> 02:23:09,286
And when I count three,

2112
02:23:09,372 --> 02:23:12,285
I want you to
let go of your gun,

2113
02:23:12,375 --> 02:23:15,868
put your palms flat on the table
and sit your ass down.

2114
02:23:16,922 --> 02:23:18,959
And when you do it,

2115
02:23:19,049 --> 02:23:21,131
you do it cool.

2116
02:23:21,218 --> 02:23:23,505
You ready?

2117
02:23:23,595 --> 02:23:25,677
One.

2118
02:23:25,764 --> 02:23:27,971
Two,

2119
02:23:28,058 --> 02:23:29,969
three.

2120
02:23:36,942 --> 02:23:40,060
[Panting] Okay, now you let him go!
Yolanda!

2121
02:23:40,153 --> 02:23:43,737
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now,
when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

2122
02:23:43,824 --> 02:23:45,906
When I get nervous,
I get scared.

2123
02:23:45,992 --> 02:23:49,781
When motherfuckers get scared, that's
when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

2124
02:23:51,456 --> 02:23:55,074
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

2125
02:23:55,168 --> 02:23:58,536
Well, that seems to be
the situation.

2126
02:23:58,630 --> 02:24:00,541
But I don't want that.

2127
02:24:00,632 --> 02:24:02,543
And you don't want that.

2128
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:05,342
And Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2129
02:24:05,428 --> 02:24:07,544
So let's see what we can do.

2130
02:24:09,933 --> 02:24:13,176
Now...
here's the situation.

2131
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:17,104
Normally both your asses would be
dead as fuckin' fried chicken,

2132
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:20,603
but you happened to pull this shit
while I'm in a transitional period,

2133
02:24:20,694 --> 02:24:23,607
and I don't wanna kill you;
I wanna help you.

2134
02:24:23,697 --> 02:24:27,611
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2135
02:24:27,701 --> 02:24:30,614
Besides, I been through too much
shit over this case this morning...

2136
02:24:30,704 --> 02:24:33,617
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2137
02:24:33,707 --> 02:24:35,493
- Vincent!
- [Yells]

2138
02:24:35,625 --> 02:24:38,538
Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
Get back!

2139
02:24:38,628 --> 02:24:41,290
It's cool!
We still just talkin'.

2140
02:24:41,423 --> 02:24:44,836
Come on. Point the gun at me. Point
the gun at me. [Yolanda Whimpering]

2141
02:24:44,926 --> 02:24:47,714
There you go.
Now, Vincent, you just hang back...

2142
02:24:47,804 --> 02:24:49,715
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2143
02:24:49,806 --> 02:24:51,672
Tell her it's still cool.

2144
02:24:51,808 --> 02:24:54,675
It's still cool, honey bunny.
How we doin', baby?

2145
02:24:56,146 --> 02:24:58,763
I- I gotta go pee.

2146
02:24:58,857 --> 02:25:00,768
I wanna go home.

2147
02:25:00,859 --> 02:25:04,443
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you.
And Ringds proud of you.

2148
02:25:04,529 --> 02:25:07,442
It's almost over.
Tell her you're proud of her.

2149
02:25:07,532 --> 02:25:10,820
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
- I love you.

2150
02:25:10,952 --> 02:25:14,115
I love you too, honey bunny.
Now,

2151
02:25:14,206 --> 02:25:18,165
I want you to go in that
bag and find my wallet.

2152
02:25:20,670 --> 02:25:24,629
Which one is it? It's the one
that says “bad motherfucker.”

2153
02:25:38,897 --> 02:25:41,434
That's it. That's my
bad motherfucker.

2154
02:25:41,524 --> 02:25:44,642
Open it up.
Take out the money.

2155
02:25:49,658 --> 02:25:51,865
[Jules]
Count it.

2156
02:25:58,166 --> 02:26:00,703
How much is there?

2157
02:26:02,587 --> 02:26:04,498
About 1,500 dollars.

2158
02:26:04,589 --> 02:26:07,752
Okay, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2159
02:26:07,842 --> 02:26:11,051
Now, with the rest of those
wallets and the register,

2160
02:26:11,137 --> 02:26:13,257
that makes this a pretty
successful little score, huh?

2161
02:26:13,306 --> 02:26:17,174
Jules, you give that fuckin' Nimrod 1,500
dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle.

2162
02:26:17,269 --> 02:26:20,682
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna
do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2163
02:26:20,772 --> 02:26:22,809
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2164
02:26:22,941 --> 02:26:26,809
Shut up! Come on, Yolanda.
Stay with me, baby.

2165
02:26:26,903 --> 02:26:29,816
Now, I ain't givin' it
to him, Vincent.

2166
02:26:29,906 --> 02:26:31,772
I'm buyin' something
for my money.

2167
02:26:33,076 --> 02:26:36,239
Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
What?

2168
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:41,039
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't have to kill your ass.

2169
02:26:41,126 --> 02:26:43,788
You read the Bible, Ringo?

Not regularly, no.

2171
02:26:46,923 --> 02:26:49,290
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2172
02:26:49,384 --> 02:26:52,922
Ezekiel 25:17.

2173
02:26:53,013 --> 02:26:55,846
“The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2174
02:26:55,932 --> 02:26:57,843
“by the inequities of the selfish...

2175
02:26:57,934 --> 02:26:59,800
“and the tyranny of evil men.

2176
02:26:59,894 --> 02:27:03,262
“Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
and good will,

2177
02:27:03,356 --> 02:27:05,768
“shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

2178
02:27:05,859 --> 02:27:09,944
“for he is truly his brother's keeper
and the finder of lost children.

2179
02:27:10,030 --> 02:27:14,319
“And I will strike down upon thee with
great vengeance and furious anger...

2180
02:27:14,409 --> 02:27:17,447
“those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers.

2181
02:27:17,537 --> 02:27:20,529
“And you will know
I am the Lord...

2182
02:27:20,623 --> 02:27:24,161
when I lay my vengeance
upon you.”

2183
02:27:25,295 --> 02:27:27,707
I been sayin' that shit
for years,

2184
02:27:27,797 --> 02:27:30,915
and if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2185
02:27:31,009 --> 02:27:33,922
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2186
02:27:34,012 --> 02:27:36,925
I just thought it was some cold blooded
shit to say to a motherfucker...

2187
02:27:37,015 --> 02:27:39,427
before I popped a cap
in his ass.

2188
02:27:39,517 --> 02:27:42,930
But I saw some shit this morning
made me think twice.

2189
02:27:43,021 --> 02:27:45,934
See, now I'm thinkin'
maybe it means...

2190
02:27:46,024 --> 02:27:50,894
you're the evil man,
and I'm the righteous man,

2191
02:27:50,987 --> 02:27:53,900
and Mr. 9-millimetre here,
he's the shepherd...

2192
02:27:53,990 --> 02:27:57,528
protecting my righteous ass
in the Valley of Darkness.

2193
02:27:57,619 --> 02:27:59,530
Or it could mean...

2194
02:27:59,621 --> 02:28:03,034
you're the righteous man,
and I'm the shepherd,

2195
02:28:03,124 --> 02:28:07,038
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2196
02:28:07,128 --> 02:28:09,369
Yeah, I'd like that.

2197
02:28:09,464 --> 02:28:12,331
But that shit ain't the truth.

2198
02:28:12,425 --> 02:28:14,291
The truth is,

2199
02:28:15,345 --> 02:28:17,302
you're the weak...

2200
02:28:18,681 --> 02:28:22,049
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2201

But I'm tryin', Ringo.

I'm tryin' real hard...

to be the shepherd.

Go.
